# Bed-Stuy Strong Grocery Parser 
This grocery parser takes free text grocery lists, tokenizes the lists, and attempts to match each token to a predefined, manually created grocery taxonomy. It also  provides limited tools for reviewing and modifying that taxonomy.  

Bed-Stuy Strong used this tool in Spring 2020 to facilitate a transition from taking free-text grocery lists, to offering a set number of items to neighbors requesting groceries, in order to enable our bulk-purchasing partnership with [Brooklyn Packers](https://www.instagram.com/brooklynpackers/). Our goal in using this tool was to identify grocery items commonly requested by our neighbors, to ensure that they were included in our future offerings.
